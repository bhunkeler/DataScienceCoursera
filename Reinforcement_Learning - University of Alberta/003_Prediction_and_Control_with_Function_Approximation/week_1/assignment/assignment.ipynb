    "\n",
    "The episode terminates when the agent reaches the terminal state (state 0) on the left, or the terminal state (state 501) on the right. Termination on the left (state 0) gives the agent a reward of -1, and termination on the right (state 501) gives the agent a reward of +1.\n",

If the agent chooses the right action, then it transitions randomly into one of the 100 neighboring states to its right. \n",

This policy takes the right action with 0.5 probability and the left with 0.5 probability, regardless of which state it is in. \n",

    "This environment has a relatively large number of states. Generalization can significantly speed learning as we will show in this assignment. Often in realistic environments, states are high-dimensional and continuous. For these problems, function approximation is not just useful, it is also necessary."

We used an environment with a large but discrete state space, where it was possible to compute the true state values. This allowed us to compare the values learned by your agent to the true state values. The same state aggregation function approximation can also be applied to continuous state space environments, where comparison to the true values is not usually possible.\n",

Asymptotically, an agent with tabular representation would be able to learn the true state value function, but it would learn much more slowly compared to an agent with function approximation.
